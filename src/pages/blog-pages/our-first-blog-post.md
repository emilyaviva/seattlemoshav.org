Welcome to Seattle Moshav's new website! We're really excited to share all the news from our community. We are hoping to build a cohousing community in Northeast Seattle that has, at its core, the Jewish values of _tikkun olam_, repairing the world, _sh'mirat ha-adamah_, responsible stewardship of the land, and _kehillah_, community.

Stay tuned to this website for more news about Seattle Moshav!
